# Project Title

In this project, we demostrate how the Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to create a web-based routing application to help
users find the most efficient way to get to their destination. This is by no means a Google Maps replacement but merely 
a proof-of-concept and school project built for the sole purpose of learning.

### Prerequisites

This project is developed on Python3.7. There is no guarantee it will work on the now deprecated Python 2.7.
The only external library used is Flask. We used it to create our web-based user interface. You can install it via pip
or run the provided setup.py file to install it.

```
pip3 install flask
```
```
python3 setup.py
```

### Running

Run the runme.py file to start the flask web server. Afterwards, you can accees the application at the following URL:
```
127.0.0.1:5000/
```
